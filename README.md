# Elemental
A visual and audio aid for sleep and relaxation.

## General information
Elemental is a visual and audio aid intended for sleep. Its purpose is to alleviate insomnia but the animation may be used for general relaxation. This is by prompting 'square breathing': a method in which the user breathes in, holds their breath, then exhales for 4 seconds each, repeatedly. As someone who suffers from insomnia, this project was undertaken to fulfill a personal desire for something simple, yet aesthetically pleasing, to use before bed.

## Technologies
* Processing 4.3
* Sound 2.4.0 (The Processing Foundation)
