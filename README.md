## General information
Elemental is a visual and audio aid intended for sleep. Its purpose is to alleviate insomnia but the animation may be used for general relaxation. This is by prompting 'square breathing': a method in which the user breathes in, holds their breath, then exhales for 4 seconds each, repeatedly. As someone who suffers from insomnia, this project was undertaken to fulfill a personal desire for something simple, yet aesthetically pleasing, to use before bed.
